I started with changing each semantic element in HTML from <div> to a better title element that fits the best. 
Then I gave each class a title of "products"  and "benefits" to be able to find where each class is on the the webpage.
Next, I added the alt attribute to describe the images on the webpage
The id attribute was added to describe all 3 product the webpage shows 

For the CSS i started by seperating each element with a comment to explain the code
All of the elements were scrambled everywhere so I put familiar elements together for a cleaner look
